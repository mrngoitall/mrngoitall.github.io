This blog follows the adventures of one Mr. William Ngo, but you can call him Will.

Will grew up in southern California in Alhambra, before moving up to Merced in California’s central valley to attend the University of California, Merced, working as a programmer/analyst for 3.5 years after graduating there as part of the pioneering class in 2009, and then left to attend a 12-week programming bootcamp called Hack Reactor, where he decided to start this blog dedicated to chronicling his adventures in learning to become a software engineer (and anything else he picks up along the way).

Also, in case you’re wondering, his last name is pronounced almost like “know” (the ‘g’ is relatively silent). And yes, that means the title of this blog is a play of his name on Dr. Seuss’ “Oh, The Places You’ll Go!”
